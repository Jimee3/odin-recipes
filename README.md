# odin-recipes
Simple recipes website created as a part of the Odin project's fundamentals course

<ins>_Disclaimer_</ins>\
These recipes are not intended to be used. For proper recipes check out:https://www.allrecipes.com/

This is the first project in the course and is focused on practicing the html skills learnt in the previous lessons. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Images used in this project are the best free images that I could easily find on google image search.

This project will be revisited later to add CSS.

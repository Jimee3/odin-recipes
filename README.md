# odin-recipes
Simple recipes website created as a part of the Odin project's fundamentals course

This is the first project in the course and is focused on practicing the html skills learnt in the previous lessons. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Images used in this project are the best free images that I could easily find on google image search.

This project will be revisited later to add CSS.
